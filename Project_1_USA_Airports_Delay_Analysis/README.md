## Introduction:
The aim of this project was to __provide insights and hints for the CEO of startup airline by showing the potential delays the new airline may encounter in different airports__.
The objective of this project was to __build self-service dynamic and interactive dashboard that shows the performance of airport in term of the metrics of managing flight delays__.

### Dataset
